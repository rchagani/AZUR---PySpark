He has a mini dodge ball and he sticks his face/mouth on the ball and all you have to do is tap the ball and he's a happy baby.  I also bought an infant gum massager electric toothbrush because he was always interested when I brush my teeth.  He loves that as well but has to be supervised so he doesn't choke, you think for long skinny objects made for babies that they would make a guard block to prevent any type of choking.This teether will be better if it had an on/ off button, my baby not able to bite down hard enough to turn it on and once again we have to hold it for him to turn it on.

However, when you get home you do not have a nurse to remind you or ask when your baby's last bowel movement was and you are so overwhelmed with the new schedule you can't even remember what day it is. The daily tracker helped us so much because once we got home our baby cried all the time, could not sleep and we were having major problems breastfeeding. It was so bad we had to contact our pediatrician's after hours on-call doctor. Looking at the tracker we realized a trend, the baby was not feeding for a long time AND we had very few wet diapers and bowel movements. This was an indication our baby was dehydrated and the doctor suggested we start pumping breast milk (to see how much we get) and supplement with formula until sufficient breast milk finally came in.

The nice thing is that if we had a rough night and we are super tired, we have something to refer to if we forgot when we last fed the baby or when he woke up. I also like that the front page has a place for emergency comments and a consent form in case your child needs medical care.  It also has a place at the back of the book for immunizations.

We hired an in-home nanny to care for our little boy and the arrangement has worked quite well ever since. Shortly after starting the arrangement we realized that we would need some sort of journal to track our little boy's activities while he was with the nanny and we were working. We used a plain notebook for a period of weeks until we stumbled on the Baby Tracker - Daily Childcare Journal.--------------------LAYOUT AND USE:The Baby Tracker is really an excellent idea. The journal pages are clearly divided into columns for tracking feedings, nap-time, diaper changes, play-time as well as general areas for notes and tracking milestones.

If you are able to grab *both* your phone and this notebook - and a pen - consistently - and at 3 in the morning - you are more skilled than me.  (I don't nurse in the same place every time.)2.) You're also often so sleep deprived that - at least for me - I'd forget to look at what time we started on a side, or what side we started on.  I'm not perfect with the app I have either, but at least I just have to mindlessly hit a button.3.) I really like the app I have (Baby Connect).  It gives me better data.

He has a mini dodge ball and he sticks his face/mouth on the ball and all you have to do is tap the ball and he's a happy baby.  I also bought an infant gum massager electric toothbrush because he was always interested when I brush my teeth.  He loves that as well but has to be supervised so he doesn't choke, you think for long skinny objects made for babies that they would make a guard block to prevent any type of choking.This teether will be better if it had an on/ off button, my baby not able to bite down hard enough to turn it on and once again we have to hold it for him to turn it on.

However, when you get home you do not have a nurse to remind you or ask when your baby's last bowel movement was and you are so overwhelmed with the new schedule you can't even remember what day it is. The daily tracker helped us so much because once we got home our baby cried all the time, could not sleep and we were having major problems breastfeeding. It was so bad we had to contact our pediatrician's after hours on-call doctor. Looking at the tracker we realized a trend, the baby was not feeding for a long time AND we had very few wet diapers and bowel movements.

The nice thing is that if we had a rough night and we are super tired, we have something to refer to if we forgot when we last fed the baby or when he woke up.

We hired an in-home nanny to care for our little boy and the arrangement has worked quite well ever since. Shortly after starting the arrangement we realized that we would need some sort of journal to track our little boy's activities while he was with the nanny and we were working. We used a plain notebook for a period of weeks until we stumbled on the Baby Tracker - Daily Childcare Journal.--------------------LAYOUT AND USE:The Baby Tracker is really an excellent idea. The journal pages are clearly divided into columns for tracking feedings, nap-time, diaper changes, play-time as well as general areas for notes and tracking milestones.

But I haven't used this thing at all, and here's why:1.) When you're breastfeeding, it's often nice to have your phone close by so that you can keep yourself entertained.  If you are able to grab *both* your phone and this notebook - and a pen - consistently - and at 3 in the morning - you are more skilled than me.  (I don't nurse in the same place every time.)2.) You're also often so sleep deprived that - at least for me - I'd forget to look at what time we started on a side, or what side we started on.  I'm not perfect with the app I have either, but at least I just have to mindlessly hit a button.3.) I really like the app I have (Baby Connect).  It gives me better data.

When he does get hold of them, exploring the ladder on the fire truck develops his fine motor skills too, and he like chewing on all of them and shaking the rattly little one!

I was trying to find a teether with vibrations he can use by himself.</td><td>04 3, 2013</td><td>A3J81R500QUZBL</td><td>dballard07</td><td>Your baby needs to be old enough...</td><td>1364947200</td><td>2013-04-03</td><td class="nestify nestify-expandable"><i class="nestify-expand fa fa-caret-right"></i>["I","have","a","6.5mo","old","who","loves","when","we","tap","on","toys","when","he","has","them","in","his","mouth,","yes","sounds","weird.","Husband","is","a","drummer","and","got","him","obsessed","with","the","tapping","even","when","he","is","drinking","out","of","his","bottle","my","baby","will","try","to","tap","the","bottle","with","his","hands","to","feel","the","vibration.","He","has","a","mini","dodge","ball","and","he","sticks","his","face/mouth","on","the","ball","and","all","you","have","to","do","is","tap","the","ball","and","he's","a","happy","baby.","I","also","bought","an","infant","gum","massager","electric","toothbrush","because","he","was","always","interested","when","I","brush","my","teeth.","He","loves","that","as","well","but","has","to","be","supervised","so","he","doesn't","choke,","you","think","for","long","skinny","objects","made","for","babies","that","they","would","make","a","guard","block","to","prevent","any","type","of","choking.This","teether","will","be","better","if","it","had","an","on/","off","button,","my","baby","not","able","to","bite","down","hard","enough","to","turn","it","on","and","once","again","we","have","to","hold","it","for","him","to","turn","it","on.","I","was","trying","to","find","a","teether","with","vibrations","he","can","use","by","himself."]</td></tr><tr><td>B00002JV9S</td><td>[0, 0]</td><td>5.0</td><td>I am so glad we invested in this product....at the time the baby was teething like a feind and this was a life saver!!!</td><td>12 17, 2013</td><td>A2MC0IMUFSW8RY</td><td>Dee Mautz</td><td>LOVE</td><td>1387238400</td><td>2013-12-17</td><td class="nestify nestify-expandable"><i class="nestify-expand fa fa-caret-right"></i>["I","am","so","glad","we","invested","in","this","product....at","the","time","the","baby","was","teething","like","a","feind","and","this","was","a","life","saver!!!"]</td></tr><tr><td>B00002JV9S</td><td>[0, 0]</td><td>4.0</td><td>thought would be a great idea for my almost 1 y/o...however, she really doesn't like it.  perhaps if i knew about it/introduced it to her when she was smaller she would be more apt to use it...she does like the rattle aspect of it and i vibrate her tummy, lol.  so it's not a complete waste</td><td>08 25, 2013</td><td>A3V0VFHSLXZO66</td><td>dmcf2 "Donna"</td><td>good idea</td><td>1377388800</td><td>2013-08-25</td><td class="nestify nestify-expandable"><i class="nestify-expand fa fa-caret-right"></i>["thought","would","be","a","great","idea","for","my","almost","1","y/o...however,","she","really","doesn't","like","it.","perhaps","if","i","knew","about","it/introduced","it","to","her","when","she","was","smaller","she","would","be","more","apt","to","use","it...she","does","like","the","rattle","aspect","of","it","and","i","vibrate","her","tummy,","lol.","so","it's","not","a","complete","waste"]</td></tr><tr><td>B00002JV9S</td><td>[0, 0]</td><td>5.0</td><td>A must in addition to all the teething toys.

He has a mini dodge ball and he sticks his face/mouth on the ball and all you have to do is tap the ball and he's a happy baby.  I also bought an infant gum massager electric toothbrush because he was always interested when I brush my teeth.  He loves that as well but has to be supervised so he doesn't choke, you think for long skinny objects made for babies that they would make a guard block to prevent any type of choking.This teether will be better if it had an on/ off button, my baby not able to bite down hard enough to turn it on and once again we have to hold it for him to turn it on.

It has been so helpful to be able to go back to track trends, answer pediatrician questions, or communicate with each other when you are up at different times of the night with a newborn.

This is super easy to use and helps me keep track of his daily routine. When he started going to the sitter when I went back to work, it helped me know how his day went to better prepare me for how the evening would most likely go. When he was sick, it help me keep track of how many diapers a day he was producing to make sure he was getting dehydrated.

The nice thing is that if we had a rough night and we are super tired, we have something to refer to if we forgot when we last fed the baby or when he woke up. I also like that the front page has a place for emergency comments and a consent form in case your child needs medical care.  It also has a place at the back of the book for immunizations.

Shortly after starting the arrangement we realized that we would need some sort of journal to track our little boy's activities while he was with the nanny and we were working. We used a plain notebook for a period of weeks until we stumbled on the Baby Tracker - Daily Childcare Journal.--------------------LAYOUT AND USE:The Baby Tracker is really an excellent idea. The journal pages are clearly divided into columns for tracking feedings, nap-time, diaper changes, play-time as well as general areas for notes and tracking milestones.

Even when I'm at work, that night I know exactly how my childs day has gone just by looking at his book. Plus it makes it easier on the caregiver to learn childs patterns as well.

We were also using an iPhone app that proved more annoying than useful.  Whenever a nurse or pediatrician walked in the room, we couldn't find which paper scrap we'd written it on. Frustrating and inaccurate. Once we started using the baby tracker, we could see easily all the info in one page, quickly update it and keep us on top of things like expected time of next feeding, etc. I have continued using it and it really makes me feel organized and in control.

When you are sleep deprived and learning everything for the first time, you don't know which way is up or down sometimes. It can be extremely overwhelming, especially when breastfeeding every 2 hours. This book is a life-saver. It literally never left my side for the first 6 months.

The cars are different colors, and each has a different number, 1 - 4, to help a child learn counting and colors. They also stack on top of each other and nest inside of each other.(The nesting feature is great for storage too). Each car has a neat fun feature for little ones to explore (e.g., the small car is also a rattle, the large fire truck's ladder moves, etc.) The cars are also very sturdy (as has been proven by my son repeatedly banging them together,) and they are easy for little hands to grab onto. At 6 months of age, my son really enjoys looking at the toys, passing them from one hand to the other, banging them together, and, of course, putting them in his mouth. I imagine this toy will remain one of my son's favorites as he learns to stack them and roll them on the floor.

This is super easy to use and helps me keep track of his daily routine. When he started going to the sitter when I went back to work, it helped me know how his day went to better prepare me for how the evening would most likely go. When he was sick, it help me keep track of how many diapers a day he was producing to make sure he was getting dehydrated.

Just finished our first one and am starting a second one.  It makes life much easier knowing my child's meal and nap times. Much easier to plan you day around baby when you can start predicting what their schedule will be for the day. Excellent for communication for when you don't have your child. Even when I'm at work, that night I know exactly how my childs day has gone just by looking at his book. Plus it makes it easier on the caregiver to learn childs patterns as well.

When you are sleep deprived and learning everything for the first time, you don't know which way is up or down sometimes. It can be extremely overwhelming, especially when breastfeeding every 2 hours. This book is a life-saver. It literally never left my side for the first 6 months.

Not a good design.[for laughs, I will leave the old review here]We originally got the diaper champ because it was a locking container that could accomodate cloth diapers.  We didn't end up cloth diapering after all, but feel fortunate to have gotten the champ.Reasons we love the champ:*1) Cost- no specialized (expensive) bags.  This takes any mid-sized household trash bag.*2) Effectively controls odors.  We've put some really eye-watering, throat gagging diapers into this contraption and the smell doesn't sneak out- even over time.  However, sometimes you have to brace yourself before opening the cover and tying off the bag.

Plus with the Diaper Champ you can flip the handle and away goes the dirty diaper. With the Diaper Genie, you have to twist the darn thing and it's hard to operate.  My mother in law almost always has problems with the Diaper Genie at my sister in laws house... she ends up cutting the bags.  When she's at my house, she can't go wrong, just flip the handle! The Diaper Champ is hands down the winner!!!!</td><td>05 10, 2005</td><td>A3JMSUIUQD6LJB</td><td>Amazon Customer</td><td>No costly bags!</td><td>1115683200</td><td>2005-05-10</td><td class="nestify nestify-expandable"><i class="nestify-expand fa fa-caret-right"></i>["I","love","this","product...","My","sister","in","law","has","a","baby","4","months","older","than","my","daughter,","and","she","has","a","diaper","genie.","She","is","stuck","having","to","buy","the","special","cartridges.","So","even","though","the","Diaper","Genie","is","less","expensive,","in","the","long","run,","the","Diaper","Champ","turns","out","to","be","the","one","that","is","less","expensive.","Plus","with","the","Diaper","Champ","you","can","flip","the","handle","and","away","goes","the","dirty","diaper.","With","the","Diaper","Genie,","you","have","to","twist","the","darn","thing","and","it's","hard","to","operate.","My","mother","in","law","almost","always","has","problems","with","the","Diaper","Genie","at","my","sister","in","laws","house...","she","ends","up","cutting","the","bags.","When","she's","at","my","house,","she","can't","go","wrong,","just","flip","the","handle!","The","Diaper","Champ","is","hands","down","the","winner!!!!"]</td><td class="nestify nestify-expandable"><i class="nestify-expand fa fa-caret-right"></i>["love","product","sister","law","babi","","month","older","daughter","diaper","geni","stuck","buy","special","cartridg","even","though","diaper","geni","less","expens","long","run","diaper","champ","turn","one","less","expens","plu","diaper","champ","can","flip","handl","away","goe","dirti","diaper","diaper","geni","twist","darn","thing","hard","oper","mother","law","almost","alway","problem","diaper","geni","sister","law","hous","end","cut","bag","she","hous","cant","go","wrong","just","flip","handl","diaper","champ","hand","winner"]</td><td class="nestify nestify-expandable"><i class="nestify-expand fa fa-caret-right"></i>["love product","product sister","sister law","law babi","babi "," month","month older","older daughter","daughter diaper","diaper geni","geni stuck","stuck buy","buy special","special cartridg","cartridg even","even though","though diaper","diaper geni","geni less","less expens","expens long","long run","run diaper","diaper champ","champ turn","turn one","one less","less expens","expens plu","plu diaper","diaper champ","champ can","can flip","flip handl","handl away","away goe","goe dirti","dirti diaper","diaper diaper","diaper geni","geni twist","twist darn","darn thing","thing hard","hard oper","oper mother","mother law","law almost","almost alway","alway problem","problem diaper","diaper geni","geni sister","sister law","law hous","hous end","end cut","cut bag","bag she","she hous","hous cant","cant go","go wrong","wrong just","just flip","flip handl","handl diaper","diaper champ","champ hand","hand winner"]</td><td class="nestify nestify-expandable"><i class="nestify-expand fa fa-caret-right"></i>["love","product","sister","law","babi","","month","older","daughter","diaper","geni","stuck","buy","special","cartridg","even","though","less","expens","long","run","champ","turn","one","plu","can","flip","handl","away","goe","dirti","twist","darn","thing","hard","oper","mother","almost","alway","problem","hous","end","cut","bag","she","cant","go","wrong","just","hand","winner","love product","product sister","sister law","law babi","babi "," month","month older","older daughter","daughter diaper","diaper geni","geni stuck","stuck buy","buy special","special cartridg","cartridg even","even though","though diaper","geni less","less expens","expens long","long run","run diaper","diaper champ","champ turn","turn one","one less","expens plu","plu diaper","champ can","can flip","flip handl","handl away","away goe","goe dirti","dirti diaper","diaper diaper","geni twist","twist darn","darn thing","thing hard","hard oper","oper mother","mother law","law almost","almost alway","alway problem","problem diaper","geni sister","law hous","hous end","end cut","cut bag","bag she","she hous","hous cant","cant go","go wrong","wrong just","just flip","handl diaper","champ hand","hand winner"]</td></tr><tr><td>B00003TL7P</td><td>[0, 0]</td><td>5.0</td><td>Diaper Champ is great.

I'll definitely continue to buy this every 3 months until at least my son is a year old.</td><td>03 26, 2013</td><td>A21I33AWNOWMK8</td><td>EmilyS</td><td>Great product!</td><td>1364256000</td><td>2013-03-26</td><td class="nestify nestify-expandable"><i class="nestify-expand fa fa-caret-right"></i>["I","have","used","this","book","since","my","son","was","born.","It's","a","great","and","handy","way","to","keep","track","of","when","and","how","much","eats","and","when","I","change","his","diaper.","Makes","it","easy","to","discuss","his","progress","with","his","doctor.","This","journal","is","great","for","his","grandparents","who","watch","him","while","I'm","gone.","They","are","able","to","maintain","his","schedule","and","it","makes","it","very","easy","for","me","to","see","how","he","is","doing","while","I'm","at","work.","Highly","recommend","this","journal","for","all","parents","of","children","especially","for","those","with","little","ones","under","a","year","of","age.","I'll","definitely","continue","to","buy","this","every","3","months","until","at","least","my","son","is","a","year","old."]</td><td class="nestify nestify-expandable"><i class="nestify-expand fa fa-caret-right"></i>["use","book","sinc","son","born","great","handi","way","keep","track","much","eat","chang","diaper","make","easi","discuss","progress","doctor","journal","great","grandpar","watch","im","gone","abl","maintain","schedul","make","easi","see","im","work","highli","recommend","journal","parent","children","especi","littl","one","year","age","ill","definit","continu","buy","everi","","month","least","son","year","old"]</td><td class="nestify nestify-expandable"><i class="nestify-expand fa fa-caret-right"></i>["use book","book sinc","sinc son","son born","born great","great handi","handi way","way keep","keep track","track much","much eat","eat chang","chang diaper","diaper make","make easi","easi discuss","discuss progress","progress doctor","doctor journal","journal great","great grandpar","grandpar watch","watch im","im gone","gone abl","abl maintain","maintain schedul","schedul make","make easi","easi see","see im","im work","work highli","highli recommend","recommend journal","journal parent","parent children","children especi","especi littl","littl one","one year","year age","age ill","ill definit","definit continu","continu buy","buy everi","everi "," month","month least","least son","son year","year old"]</td><td class="nestify nestify-expandable"><i class="nestify-expand fa fa-caret-right"></i>["use","book","sinc","son","born","great","handi","way","keep","track","much","eat","chang","diaper","make","easi","discuss","progress","doctor","journal","grandpar","watch","im","gone","abl","maintain","schedul","see","work","highli","recommend","parent","children","especi","littl","one","year","age","ill","definit","continu","buy","everi","","month","least","old","use book","book sinc","sinc son","son born","born great","great handi","handi way","way keep","keep track","track much","much eat","eat chang","chang diaper","diaper make","make easi","easi discuss","discuss progress","progress doctor","doctor journal","journal great","great grandpar","grandpar watch","watch im","im gone","gone abl","abl maintain","maintain schedul","schedul make","easi see","see im","im work","work highli","highli recommend","recommend journal","journal parent","parent children","children especi","especi littl","littl one","one year","year age","age ill","ill definit","definit continu","continu buy","buy everi","everi "," month","month least","least son","son year","year old"]</td></tr><tr><td>9729375011</td><td>[0, 0]</td><td>5.0</td><td>I am 4 weeks from delivery of my first baby and was looking for a newborn tracker.

We were also using an iPhone app that proved more annoying than useful.  Whenever a nurse or pediatrician walked in the room, we couldn't find which paper scrap we'd written it on. Frustrating and inaccurate. Once we started using the baby tracker, we could see easily all the info in one page, quickly update it and keep us on top of things like expected time of next feeding, etc. I have continued using it and it really makes me feel organized and in control.

Not a good design.[for laughs, I will leave the old review here]We originally got the diaper champ because it was a locking container that could accomodate cloth diapers.  We didn't end up cloth diapering after all, but feel fortunate to have gotten the champ.Reasons we love the champ:*1) Cost- no specialized (expensive) bags.  This takes any mid-sized household trash bag.*2) Effectively controls odors.  We've put some really eye-watering, throat gagging diapers into this contraption and the smell doesn't sneak out- even over time.  However, sometimes you have to brace yourself before opening the cover and tying off the bag.

Plus with the Diaper Champ you can flip the handle and away goes the dirty diaper. With the Diaper Genie, you have to twist the darn thing and it's hard to operate.  My mother in law almost always has problems with the Diaper Genie at my sister in laws house... she ends up cutting the bags.  When she's at my house, she can't go wrong, just flip the handle! The Diaper Champ is hands down the winner!!!!</td><td>05 10, 2005</td><td>A3JMSUIUQD6LJB</td><td>Amazon Customer</td><td>No costly bags!</td><td>1115683200</td><td>2005-05-10</td><td class="nestify nestify-expandable"><i class="nestify-expand fa fa-caret-right"></i>["I","love","this","product...","My","sister","in","law","has","a","baby","4","months","older","than","my","daughter,","and","she","has","a","diaper","genie.","She","is","stuck","having","to","buy","the","special","cartridges.","So","even","though","the","Diaper","Genie","is","less","expensive,","in","the","long","run,","the","Diaper","Champ","turns","out","to","be","the","one","that","is","less","expensive.","Plus","with","the","Diaper","Champ","you","can","flip","the","handle","and","away","goes","the","dirty","diaper.","With","the","Diaper","Genie,","you","have","to","twist","the","darn","thing","and","it's","hard","to","operate.","My","mother","in","law","almost","always","has","problems","with","the","Diaper","Genie","at","my","sister","in","laws","house...","she","ends","up","cutting","the","bags.","When","she's","at","my","house,","she","can't","go","wrong,","just","flip","the","handle!","The","Diaper","Champ","is","hands","down","the","winner!!!!"]</td><td class="nestify nestify-expandable"><i class="nestify-expand fa fa-caret-right"></i>["love","product","sister","law","babi","","month","older","daughter","diaper","geni","stuck","buy","special","cartridg","even","though","diaper","geni","less","expens","long","run","diaper","champ","turn","one","less","expens","plu","diaper","champ","can","flip","handl","away","goe","dirti","diaper","diaper","geni","twist","darn","thing","hard","oper","mother","law","almost","alway","problem","diaper","geni","sister","law","hous","end","cut","bag","she","hous","cant","go","wrong","just","flip","handl","diaper","champ","hand","winner"]</td><td class="nestify nestify-expandable"><i class="nestify-expand fa fa-caret-right"></i>["love product","product sister","sister law","law babi","babi "," month","month older","older daughter","daughter diaper","diaper geni","geni stuck","stuck buy","buy special","special cartridg","cartridg even","even though","though diaper","diaper geni","geni less","less expens","expens long","long run","run diaper","diaper champ","champ turn","turn one","one less","less expens","expens plu","plu diaper","diaper champ","champ can","can flip","flip handl","handl away","away goe","goe dirti","dirti diaper","diaper diaper","diaper geni","geni twist","twist darn","darn thing","thing hard","hard oper","oper mother","mother law","law almost","almost alway","alway problem","problem diaper","diaper geni","geni sister","sister law","law hous","hous end","end cut","cut bag","bag she","she hous","hous cant","cant go","go wrong","wrong just","just flip","flip handl","handl diaper","diaper champ","champ hand","hand winner"]</td><td class="nestify nestify-expandable"><i class="nestify-expand fa fa-caret-right"></i>["love","product","sister","law","babi","","month","older","daughter","diaper","geni","stuck","buy","special","cartridg","even","though","less","expens","long","run","champ","turn","one","plu","can","flip","handl","away","goe","dirti","twist","darn","thing","hard","oper","mother","almost","alway","problem","hous","end","cut","bag","she","cant","go","wrong","just","hand","winner","love product","product sister","sister law","law babi","babi "," month","month older","older daughter","daughter diaper","diaper geni","geni stuck","stuck buy","buy special","special cartridg","cartridg even","even though","though diaper","geni less","less expens","expens long","long run","run diaper","diaper champ","champ turn","turn one","one less","expens plu","plu diaper","champ can","can flip","flip handl","handl away","away goe","goe dirti","dirti diaper","diaper diaper","geni twist","twist darn","darn thing","thing hard","hard oper","oper mother","mother law","law almost","almost alway","alway problem","problem diaper","geni sister","law hous","hous end","end cut","cut bag","bag she","she hous","hous cant","cant go","go wrong","wrong just","just flip","handl diaper","champ hand","hand winner"]</td></tr><tr><td>B00003TL7P</td><td>[0, 0]</td><td>5.0</td><td>Diaper Champ is great.

When he was sick, it help me keep track of how many diapers a day he was producing to make sure he was getting dehydrated. The note sections to the side and bottom are useful too because his sitter writes in small notes about whether or not he liked his lunch or if the playtime included going for a walk, etc.Excellent for moms who are wanting to keep track of their kids daily routine even though they are at work.

We've recorded so many milestones since we received this.  It is a 6 month diary and has room for notes.  I wish the hours started around 6 am and went until 8 pm, but we just write over certain times to suit our purposes. The nice thing is that if we had a rough night and we are super tired, we have something to refer to if we forgot when we last fed the baby or when he woke up. I also like that the front page has a place for emergency comments and a consent form in case your child needs medical care.  It also has a place at the back of the book for immunizations.  I'll definitely get another one in 6 months when we finish this book.</td><td>02 26, 2013</td><td>A3O4ATU0ENBKTU</td><td>MAPN</td><td>Compact and Easy way to record the

I knew that I wouldn't have time to work on his baby book in the beginning (and sure enough I didn't even get it out until after 2 months), and because I had this book I was able to finally transfer everything over.

It's a great and handy way to keep track of when and how much eats and when I change his diaper.  Makes it easy to discuss his progress with his doctor.  This journal is great for his grandparents who watch him while I'm gone.  They are able to maintain his schedule and it makes it very easy for me to see how he is doing while I'm at work.  Highly recommend this journal for all parents of children especially for those with little ones under a year of age.

Just finished our first one and am starting a second one.  It makes life much easier knowing my child's meal and nap times. Much easier to plan you day around baby when you can start predicting what their schedule will be for the day. Excellent for communication for when you don't have your child. Even when I'm at work, that night I know exactly how my childs day has gone just by looking at his book. Plus it makes it easier on the caregiver to learn childs patterns as well. I recommend this to all new moms!

We did, but it stayed in the suitcase for 2 days because we were SO &amp;#34;out of it&amp;#34; dealing with my c-section,, etc. We  had been keeping notes -on loose sheets of paper- of baby's feedings and diaper output (so crucial those first few days). We were also using an iPhone app that proved more annoying than useful.  Whenever a nurse or pediatrician walked in the room, we couldn't find which paper scrap we'd written it on. Frustrating and inaccurate. Once we started using the baby tracker, we could see easily all the info in one page, quickly update it and keep us on top of things like expected time of next feeding, etc. I have continued using it and it really makes me feel organized and in control. I carry it around the house with baby, and my husband can add entries using the same format- no more trying to rely on memory to see baby's needs and patterns.

They also stack on top of each other and nest inside of each other.(The nesting feature is great for storage too). Each car has a neat fun feature for little ones to explore (e.g., the small car is also a rattle, the large fire truck's ladder moves, etc.) The cars are also very sturdy (as has been proven by my son repeatedly banging them together,) and they are easy for little hands to grab onto. At 6 months of age, my son really enjoys looking at the toys, passing them from one hand to the other, banging them together, and, of course, putting them in his mouth. I imagine this toy will remain one of my son's favorites as he learns to stack them and roll them on the floor. I would highly recommend this item.</td><td>11 3, 2002</td><td>AFM7DWQ762149</td><td>S.

The cars are different colors, and each has a different number, 1 - 4, to help a child learn counting and colors. They also stack on top of each other and nest inside of each other.(The nesting feature is great for storage too). Each car has a neat fun feature for little ones to explore (e.g., the small car is also a rattle, the large fire truck's ladder moves, etc.) The cars are also very sturdy (as has been proven by my son repeatedly banging them together,) and they are easy for little hands to grab onto. At 6 months of age, my son really enjoys looking at the toys, passing them from one hand to the other, banging them together, and, of course, putting them in his mouth. I imagine this toy will remain one of my son's favorites as he learns to stack them and roll them on the floor.

It may seem strange or uncomfortable at first but I still use my sling with my daughter and she's 18 months now. She sits on my hip and watches me do the dishes or fold laundry.

It has a lot of room to store the dirty diapers, and yet there is little to no smell. You know when it's full because the plunger won't go down all the way, and you can't return the handle to the other position. When you take the garbage bag out, you can tell just how much smell you'd be in for with any other container. I also like that you can use whatever garbage bags you want with this, instead of having to buy special ones. A good buy.</td><td>12 25, 2005</td><td>A1MKS8KSK36VES</td><td>A.

It WILL STINK TERRIBLY in a little over a year because they put a foam and cloth gasket (porous) to keep the stink in.  Not a good design.[for laughs, I will leave the old review here]We originally got the diaper champ because it was a locking container that could accomodate cloth diapers.  We didn't end up cloth diapering after all, but feel fortunate to have gotten the champ.Reasons we love the champ:*1) Cost- no specialized (expensive) bags.  This takes any mid-sized household trash bag.*2) Effectively controls odors.  We've put some really eye-watering, throat gagging diapers into this contraption and the smell doesn't sneak out- even over time.  However, sometimes you have to brace yourself before opening the cover and tying off the bag.  That smell can bowl you over.*3) Easy enough ...</td><td>02 26, 2006</td><td>A2XZ7OFHNNKOQU</td><td>Adrienne Jones "Baby Toolkit"</td><td>USED TO LOVE IT: Read my new review rather than this

She said that it did a good job and I didn't have to buy any special bags. So I went out and bought it along with a big box of tall kitchen bags. My son is now 4 months old, and so far it is working great. It is in the nursery and there is no smell at all. I am usually very sensitive about any bad smells, and so is my mom but even she couldnt smell any odors. So far this has been a great product. The lid is definately tight, but it does not bother me much. Hopefully, it will still work when the diapers get REALLY smelly!

It is easier to use. There were no smell problems AT ALL until about 18months - 2years old, well "hello - diet change produces stinkier diapers". Makes sense. . but still use it for wet diapers. Hopefully potty training will happen soon! :)The only down-side, is that babysitters are so "diaper genieized" they pop off the side handle trying to do it the wrong way. But the good side is, it is easy to pop back on.The diaper champ is really durable.

When he was sick, it help me keep track of how many diapers a day he was producing to make sure he was getting dehydrated. The note sections to the side and bottom are useful too because his sitter writes in small notes about whether or not he liked his lunch or if the playtime included going for a walk, etc.Excellent for moms who are wanting to keep track of their kids daily routine even though they are at work.

Once I used up the entire book, I bought this Baby Tracker, which tracks only days since my daughter is sleeping during the night now.

The daily tracker helped us so much because once we got home our baby cried all the time, could not sleep and we were having major problems breastfeeding. It was so bad we had to contact our pediatrician's after hours on-call doctor. Looking at the tracker we realized a trend, the baby was not feeding for a long time AND we had very few wet diapers and bowel movements. This was an indication our baby was dehydrated and the doctor suggested we start pumping breast milk (to see how much we get) and supplement with formula until sufficient breast milk finally came in.

We've recorded so many milestones since we received this.  It is a 6 month diary and has room for notes.  I wish the hours started around 6 am and went until 8 pm, but we just write over certain times to suit our purposes. The nice thing is that if we had a rough night and we are super tired, we have something to refer to if we forgot when we last fed the baby or when he woke up. I also like that the front page has a place for emergency comments and a consent form in case your child needs medical care.  It also has a place at the back of the book for immunizations.

Our Pediatrician is always asking # of Wets and # of Dirty Diapers per day...so I bring this book to our appts and let her see it all.  I color code each item so its very easy to tell at a glance when he last ate, slept, or pottied.

It's a great and handy way to keep track of when and how much eats and when I change his diaper.  Makes it easy to discuss his progress with his doctor.  This journal is great for his grandparents who watch him while I'm gone.  They are able to maintain his schedule and it makes it very easy for me to see how he is doing while I'm at work.  Highly recommend this journal for all parents of children especially for those with little ones under a year of age.  I'll definitely continue to buy this every 3 months until at least my son is a year old.</td><td>03 26, 2013</td><td>A21I33AWNOWMK8</td><td>EmilyS</td><td>Great

Just finished our first one and am starting a second one.  It makes life much easier knowing my child's meal and nap times. Much easier to plan you day around baby when you can start predicting what their schedule will be for the day. Excellent for communication for when you don't have your child. Even when I'm at work, that night I know exactly how my childs day has gone just by looking at his book. Plus it makes it easier on the caregiver to learn childs patterns as well. I recommend this to all new moms! Especially during those first few weeks/months when growth spurts are common and you can't remember anything because you haven't slept much!</td><td>10 28,

We were also using an iPhone app that proved more annoying than useful.  Whenever a nurse or pediatrician walked in the room, we couldn't find which paper scrap we'd written it on. Frustrating and inaccurate. Once we started using the baby tracker, we could see easily all the info in one page, quickly update it and keep us on top of things like expected time of next feeding, etc. I have continued using it and it really makes me feel organized and in control. I carry it around the house with baby, and my husband can add entries using the same format- no more trying to rely on memory to see baby's needs and patterns.

The cars are different colors, and each has a different number, 1 - 4, to help a child learn counting and colors. They also stack on top of each other and nest inside of each other.(The nesting feature is great for storage too). Each car has a neat fun feature for little ones to explore (e.g., the small car is also a rattle, the large fire truck's ladder moves, etc.) The cars are also very sturdy (as has been proven by my son repeatedly banging them together,) and they are easy for little hands to grab onto. At 6 months of age, my son really enjoys looking at the toys, passing them from one hand to the other, banging them together, and, of course, putting them in his mouth. I imagine this toy will remain one of my son's favorites as he learns to stack them and roll them on the floor. I would highly recommend this item.</td><td>11 3, 2002</td><td>AFM7DWQ762149</td><td>S.

The cars are different colors, and each has a different number, 1 - 4, to help a child learn counting and colors. They also stack on top of each other and nest inside of each other.(The nesting feature is great for storage too). Each car has a neat fun feature for little ones to explore (e.g., the small car is also a rattle, the large fire truck's ladder moves, etc.) The cars are also very sturdy (as has been proven by my son repeatedly banging them together,) and they are easy for little hands to grab onto. At 6 months of age, my son really enjoys looking at the toys, passing them from one hand to the other, banging them together, and, of course, putting them in his mouth. I imagine this toy will remain one of my son's favorites as he learns to stack them and roll them on the floor.

It WILL STINK TERRIBLY in a little over a year because they put a foam and cloth gasket (porous) to keep the stink in.  Not a good design.[for laughs, I will leave the old review here]We originally got the diaper champ because it was a locking container that could accomodate cloth diapers.  We didn't end up cloth diapering after all, but feel fortunate to have gotten the champ.Reasons we love the champ:*1) Cost- no specialized (expensive) bags.  This takes any mid-sized household trash bag.*2) Effectively controls odors.  We've put some really eye-watering, throat gagging diapers into this contraption and the smell doesn't sneak out- even over time.  However, sometimes you have to brace yourself before opening the cover and tying off the bag.  That smell can bowl you over.*3) Easy enough ...</td><td>02 26, 2006</td><td>A2XZ7OFHNNKOQU</td><td>Adrienne Jones "Baby Toolkit"</td><td>USED TO LOVE IT: Read my new review rather than this

She said that it did a good job and I didn't have to buy any special bags. So I went out and bought it along with a big box of tall kitchen bags. My son is now 4 months old, and so far it is working great. It is in the nursery and there is no smell at all. I am usually very sensitive about any bad smells, and so is my mom but even she couldnt smell any odors. So far this has been a great product. The lid is definately tight, but it does not bother me much. Hopefully, it will still work when the diapers get REALLY smelly!

It is easier to use. There were no smell problems AT ALL until about 18months - 2years old, well "hello - diet change produces stinkier diapers". Makes sense. . but still use it for wet diapers. Hopefully potty training will happen soon! :)The only down-side, is that babysitters are so "diaper genieized" they pop off the side handle trying to do it the wrong way. But the good side is, it is easy to pop back on.The diaper champ is really durable.
